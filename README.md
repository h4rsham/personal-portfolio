# Personal Portfolio ExperimentationðŸ¤–

## Description

Within this repository, I went through the process of learning Next.js and Tailwind CSS to expand my knowledge and create a portfolio website.

## Demo

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="./public/Main.png" alt="initial screen" style="width: 33.33%;">
  <img src="./public/Second.png" alt="middle of page" style="width: 33.33%;">
  <img src="./public/Last.png" alt="bottom of page" style="width: 33.33%;">
  <img src="./public/MainLight.png" alt="initial screen" style="width: 33.33%;">
  <img src="./public/SecondLight.png" alt="middle of page" style="width: 33.33%;">
  <img src="./public/LastLight.png" alt="bottom of page" style="width: 33.33%;">
</div>


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 19.9.0)
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-install) (>= 9.6.3)


## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Next](https://nextjs.org/) - A a popular open-source framework for building server-rendered React applications.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.


## Future Improvements & Challenges Faced

- Completion of light/dark mode toggle - issues with useState implementation within Next.js.
- From the very beginning, it was a struggle to understand how Next.js and TailwindCSS even worked in the first place and so understanding this was a huge pain!


## Key Takeaways

- Managed to learn how to effectively implement Tailwind CSS.
- Growing understanding of how Next.js works.
- Improvement on personal CSS/styling ability.
