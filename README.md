<img src="./public/MainLight.png" alt="initial screen">
<img src="./public/SecondLight.png" alt="middle of page">
<img src="./public/LastLight.png" alt="bottom of page">



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 19.9.0)

## Future Improvements & Challenges Faced

- Completion of light/dark mode toggle - issues with useState implementation within Next.js.
- From the very beginning, it was a struggle to understand how Next.js and TailwindCSS even worked in the first place and so understanding this was a huge pain!
