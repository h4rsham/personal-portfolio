# Personal Portfolio ExperimentationðŸ¤–

## Description

Within this repository, I went through the process of learning Next.js and Tailwind CSS to expand my knowledge and create a portfolio website.

## Demo

[Find the Deployed Site Here](https://tictactoe-jylu.onrender.com/)
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 19.9.0)
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-install) (>= 9.6.3)


## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Next](https://nextjs.org/) - A a popular open-source framework for building server-rendered React applications.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.


## Future Improvements

- Improve the website responsiveness so that it can be used on devices other than a desktop

- Changing the generic X's and O's to something more creative like Blue/Red pills

- Change the background to be more user engaging such as an image of green lines of code running

Hopefully you can see where I'm going with this...
